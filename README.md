# thrallbot
A Discord bot for when your disapproval needs to be known. Mention "bad post thrall" and this image:
![Bad Post Thrall](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/244960108239388682/310537986884370432/Wow-64_2017-04-27_20-36-22-27.png)
will be posted three times in response. Due to the size of the image, this will easily obscure whatever content earned your disapproval. Plus, your entire server will be greeted with Thrall looking up disapprovingly at the offending content.
